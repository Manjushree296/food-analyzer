# NOTE: Do NOT pin `torch`/`torchvision` here. Install them with the
# official PyTorch wheels for your platform (see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
# Pinning specific torch builds in this file often causes "ResolutionImpossible" errors
# because PyTorch wheels are platform/CUDA-specific and the resolver can't satisfy
# binary wheel constraints together with other packages.
# Example (CPU-only) - run manually in your environment:
#   pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch torchvision
# Or for CUDA (example for CUDA 11.8):
#   pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 torch torchvision
